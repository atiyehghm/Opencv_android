# Opencv_android
in this project we're going to work with opencv in android. we'll start by installation then some simple projects and importing some sample projects from opencv documentation.

## what is opencv? and for what kind of applications is used?
opencv is an open source software library for computer vision, machine learning and image proccessing.it can aprox. do all the functionaities of image processing like identifying faces, objects and handwritings in images, producing high resolution images and so on.you can read more in this [link](https://opencv.org/about/) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV)

## installation
1. go to [the opencv site](https://opencv.org). go to releases and find the latest version of opencv and click on android.(it's recommended to download the version that is the latest version according to the version of your android studio.For example my android studio version is 3.5.3 so i downloaded 3.4.10)

2. once the download finished unzip it in some location.(for those who are on windows, `c:\program files` is recommended. and for those on mac and linux, `Users/yourname/android/opencv-android-sdk` is recommended.

3.then start a new project in android studio. then from the menu bar select `new -> import module`.

4. select the java file in opencv-sdk and click next and then finish.

5. after adding the java file you will get the following error.click on `remove minSdkVersion and sync project` and then click on `Do refactor` to fix this error. This error basically happens because the minSdkversion of the opencv librery is different from the version in your app's androidManifest.

6. go to the `file -> project structure -> dependencies -> All modules -> + ->module dependency -> app` and then mark `opencv3410`.
